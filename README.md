# GusMap Version 0.1

Genotyping Uncertainty with Sequencing data and linkage MAPping (GusMap).

An R package for performing linkage mapping using low (or high) coverage sequencing data with requiring filtering with respect to read depth. This release accompanies the publication by Bilton et al. (2017).  

### Installation:

Note: Some of the functions are coded in C and therefore an appropriate C complier is needed for the package to work. For windows OS, Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) provides a complier.
