\title{Release information for GusMap}
\section{Version 0.1}{
This is the first release of GusMap. This verison accompanies the publication by Bilton et al. (2017).

\subsection{FEATURES}{
  As this verison is only an early verison of the package, there are only a few features at present which are:
  \itemize{
  \item Phase inference on a set of ordered SNPs for a full-sib family.
  \item Recombation fraction estimation for an order set of SNPs using sequencing data without requiring the need to filter with respect to read depth for multiple full-sib families.
  \item Simulation of sequencing data for a full-sib family and functions to convert data into various other software formats. 
  }
 }
 More features are intended to be added on as the package is developed. Suggestions for particular improvements are welcome.
