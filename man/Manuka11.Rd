\title{Manuka chromosome 11 SNPs}
\usage{
Manuka11()
}
\value{
Function outputs a character string of the complete path to the data set in the package.
}
\description{
Function for extracting the path to the (VCF) file of the Manuka data used in the publication by Bilton et
al. (2017).
}
\details{
The data consists of 680 SNPs, genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing
methods. The data is in VCF format (see this \href{https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf}{page} 
for specification of VCF format).
