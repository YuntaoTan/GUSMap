### R Function for reading in the Manuka data of chromosome 11.
### Author: Timothy Bilton
### Date: 26/01/18

## Wrapper function for reading in the Manuka data set for chromosome 11


#' Manuka chromosome 11 SNPs
#' 
#' Function for extracting the path to the (VCF) file of the Manuka data used in the publication by Bilton et
#' al. (2017).
#' 
#' The data consists of 680 SNPs, genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing
#' methods. The data is in VCF format (see this \href{https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf}{page} 
#' for specification of VCF format).
#' 
#' @return Function outputs a character string of the complete path to the data set in the package.

#' P.L., Dodds K.G. (2017). Accounting for errors in low coverage high-throughput
#' sequencing data when constructing genetic maps using biparental outcrossed
#' populations. Unpublished Manuscript.
